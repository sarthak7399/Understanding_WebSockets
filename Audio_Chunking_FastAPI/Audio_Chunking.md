# Audio Chunking with WebSocket Explanation

This document explains the code flow and implementation details of the audio streaming functionality using WebSocket in the provided HTML/JavaScript client-side code.

## Client-Side Code Explanation:

### HTML Structure:
- The HTML file contains a simple button with the id `connectButton` to establish a WebSocket connection and an audio element with the id `audioPlayer` for audio playback.

### JavaScript Code:
1. **WebSocket Connection Setup**:
   - When the user clicks the "Connect" button, a WebSocket connection is established with the server at `ws://localhost:8000/audio`.
   - Upon successful connection (`onopen` event), the console logs a message indicating that the WebSocket connection has been established.

2. **Receiving Audio Chunks**:
   - When the WebSocket receives a message (`onmessage` event), it checks if the received data is an instance of `Blob`, which represents a binary large object (in this case, an audio chunk).
   - If it's a `Blob`, the audio chunk is added to the `audioChunks` buffer.
   - If it's the first chunk received, the `playNextChunk()` function is called to start playing the audio.

3. **Playing Audio Chunks**:
   - The `playNextChunk()` function plays the next audio chunk in the buffer sequentially.
   - It sets the source of the audio element (`audioPlayer.src`) to the URL of the current audio chunk.
   - It then plays the audio using the `play()` method of the audio element.
   - After the audio playback ends (detected by the `ended` event of the audio element), it increments the `currentChunkIndex` to move to the next chunk and plays it.

### Audio Playback Control:
- The audio element's `controls` attribute allows users to control audio playback (e.g., play, pause, seek) using the built-in controls provided by the browser.

## Conclusion:
- This client-side code establishes a WebSocket connection with the server to receive audio chunks.
- It buffers the received audio chunks and plays them sequentially to ensure smooth audio streaming.
- Users can control audio playback using the built-in controls of the audio element.
- The code ensures that each audio chunk is played seamlessly without interruptions, providing a smooth streaming experience.


## Server-Side Code Explanation:

### Imports and App Initialization:
- The code imports necessary modules from FastAPI and initializes a FastAPI application (`app`).

### WebSocket Endpoint Definition:
1. **WebSocket Connection Setup**:
   - When a client connects to the `/audio` WebSocket endpoint, the `audio` function is called.
   - Inside the `audio` function, the WebSocket connection is accepted (`await websocket.accept()`), and a message indicating that the WebSocket connection has been established is printed to the console.

2. **Audio Streaming**:
   - The `stream_audio` function is defined to stream audio data to the WebSocket client.
   - Inside this function, the audio file (`static/audio.mp3`) is opened in binary read mode.
   - Audio data is read from the file in chunks of 1MB (`1024 * 1024` bytes).
   - Each audio chunk is sent to the WebSocket client using the `send_bytes` method of the WebSocket object.
   - After sending each chunk, a small delay (`await asyncio.sleep(0.1)`) is added to control the rate of data transmission.

### Conclusion:
- This server-side code defines a WebSocket endpoint (`/audio`) to stream audio data to clients.
- When a client connects to this endpoint, a WebSocket connection is established, and audio data is streamed in 1MB chunks to the client.
- The code ensures smooth streaming of audio data over WebSocket, providing real-time playback on the client side.
